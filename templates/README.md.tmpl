# DeSciX

Open source has no economic model. Researchers and creators give their work away, and the value
it creates accrues somewhere else. DeSciX exists to change that: contributors share in what their
contributions are worth.

It is a federated mesh of tokenized community apps — knowledge bases you can ask, services you
can call, and a self-custody wallet — and it runs **headless**. There is no dashboard to learn.
You connect Claude to the platform and ask for what you want.

## Start here

**1 — Install**

```
/plugin marketplace add DeSciX/daita
/plugin install daita@daita
```

On Cowork: chat **+** → **Add plugins…** → **Add marketplace**.

The marketplace carries two plugins. **daita** is this on-ramp. **daita-beast** is Beast, the
coordination layer for agent teams — install it as well if you want it:

```
/plugin install daita-beast@daita
```

Both list the same connector, and one connect serves both.

**2 — Run setup**

```
/descix-setup
```

It creates your account (secured by a passkey, which is also your wallet — no password), points
you at **Manage Connectors** to connect the DeSciX connector once, and confirms you can reach the
platform. Connecting costs nothing and needs no credits.

**3 — Use a community**

Communities are the products. Each one owns its knowledge, its apps, and its token.

```
find_communities({})
ask_question_to_app({ app_id: "<app>", user_input: "<your question>" })
```

Answers come back **cited**, with retrievable source ids — the point is that you can check them.

## What it costs

AI usage is metered in USD credits, the same way an AI API bills. A **free daily credit applies
automatically to your first metered call each day**, so you can start without buying anything.
You can top up by card at 1:1 when you want more. Full detail: [credits](docs/credits.md).

|---|---|
| [Connecting Claude](docs/mcp.md) | The connector, the discovery loop, what's advertised at handshake |
| [Credits](docs/credits.md) | How metering, the free daily credit, and the shared pool work |
| [License](LICENSE) | The DeSciX Community Agreement |

## The agreement

Participation runs under the **DeSciX Community Agreement (DCMA)** — a real-world IP licence
deriving from the grants creators make, not a smart contract. DeSciX has regulatory obligations
that a contract alone cannot meet, which is why the licence is the foundation and the chain is a
settlement layer beneath it.

The DCMA is explicitly living and evolving, and the structure it describes is early. That is
stated plainly because the first people here are participants in working it out, not customers
receiving a finished system.
